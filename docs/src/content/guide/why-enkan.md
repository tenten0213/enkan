# Why Enkan?

Enkan is a minimal framework inspired by [ring-clojure](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring). We built Enkan and Kotowari to solve one problem:
**building a web application by more explicit and simple way.**

## Explicitness

- Middleware pattern
- No configuration files
- Anti-blackbox
- Avoid annotation hell

## Ease of Development

- Hot reloading
- Kindly exception for misconfiguration
- Trace the request / response

## Ease of Operation

- Start server quickly
- Metrics ready
- All in the REPL

## Kotowari

Kotowari is a minimal web framework on Enkan.

- Rails-like routing
- HTML template rendering
- Serialize/Deserialize a java object from various message formats.
